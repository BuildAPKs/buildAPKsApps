<P>As you see, the board is divided in 8x8 cells. Each cell may contain a piece of
size one, two or three. Initially each player has three pieces in size two.
<P>The players take turns to select one of their own pieces to be increased one in size.
If a size three piece is selected, it will "overflow", which means that it will be split
into four small pieces, which are then distributed to the neighbor cells (left, right,
up, down). If a neighbor is also a size three piece, it will also "overflow". Thus you
can get rather long chain reactions.
<P>The opponents pieces can only be taken by "overflowing" your own pieces into them.
If one of your pieces is distributed to a cell occupied by one of the opponent's
pieces, that piece changes color and is increased by one in size. That way you can win
an entire chain of the opponent's pieces in one move, if you play wisely.
<P>Pieces that falls off the edge of the board are lost. Don't worry too much about this
though, the game is not about having many pieces, just about having ALL the pieces ;-)
<P>The winner in the game is the player who captures all the pieces on the board.
<P>Although the rules are very simple, the game is not easy to play at all. There are a
lot of tips and tricks to learn.
