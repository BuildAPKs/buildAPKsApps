    <string name="help_text">"  It is really simple decision maker toy. It uses random numbers. It is better than flipping a coin, because it has more options. 
\n  The usage is very simple. You need to have a specific question in mind, for which it is difficult for you to take a solution. After that, just hit the roll button and observe the result. 
\n  Have in mind that all final decisions are your own responsibility. This is just a toy and it can not help you in really difficult or dangerous situations.  
\n  Good luck and have fun!"</string>
