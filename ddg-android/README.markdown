ddg-android - Duck Duck Go on your Android phone
================================================
ddg-android integrates Duck Duck Go to your phone in two ways.


1. It adds Duck Duck Go as a web search engine. This means that when you press your search button to search the web, you will get the results from Duck Duck Go instead of Google.


2. (2.2 only) It adds Duck Duck Go as a searchable item on your phone. This means that you can add a Duck Duck Go search box widget on your home screen. See [this screenshot.](http://www.csc.kth.se/~johanhil/ddgwidget.png)
