Comments and thoughts about the DDG Android design:
DuckDuckGo does the heavy lifting, consisting of appending the user's query to
a base url.

DuckDuckGoSettings is a failed attempt to present the user with some preferences like 
Settings -> Search -> Google search. Right now it functions as the main screen of sorts.

DummyProvider provides the user with bang suggestions. It is also used to add Duck Duck Go to the list of searchable items under
Settings -> Search -> Searchable Items. If DDG is checked there, it is possible add
a search widget on a home screen which searches DDG.
Long-press on the homescreen, choose Widgets, scroll down and choose Google search and
then choose Duck Duck Go. Voila!
