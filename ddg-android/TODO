* Redo the bang system.
    - Add more bangs.
    - Create a system to manage the bangs (right now it's two arrays which needs to be kept in sync. not cool).
    - Somehow order the bangs to make it easy for the user to find the right bang.

* Add screenshots and redo the help text to be simpler and easier.
    - Add a javascript listener to the webview so that a simple "here" link can
    replace the "Go Settings > ..." lines.
